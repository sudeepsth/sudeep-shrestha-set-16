	I would use agile model for developing custom design/printed T-shirt website/app. As web-based application differ from other traditional applications as it is known to be of high reliability, high usability, more secured, takes a shorter time to market, have a shorter product life cycles and required continuous maintenance. So, Agile model suits from this type of website.

For developing a web application for the company, I will ensure that the development process is short and its within the specific budget of the company. I will plan for the development of the website by following ways.

1) First of all I will find out as much as detail about clientâ€™s company and find out their project goals. And then I will also find out the purpose of this project and their end goals. 

2) I will develop the prototype of the website and then send it to client for feedback.

3) After receiving the feedback, I will design and develop the website and actively asked for further feedback from the client.
